MSCP - Minecraft Server Control Panel
=====================================

A makeshift interface for controlling a linux Minecraft server, shows log in realtime and can send commands to the server.
Uses [msm](https://github.com/marcuswhybrow/minecraft-server-manager) to send commands to the server itself as of now.

**As of now, things change a lot, breaks from time to time and most settings are hardcoded**

##Requirements
Might change as times change, but as of now:
* Linux-based Minecraft server with filesystem access
* PHP+PDO
* MySQL
* Python
* [msm](https://github.com/marcuswhybrow/minecraft-server-manager)

> Organically grown.
